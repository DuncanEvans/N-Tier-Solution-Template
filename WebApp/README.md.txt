# App Presentation Layer
The Presentation Layer is responsible of hosting the user interface of your application. As an example, in this layer you will have all the .aspx pages and .ascx user controls along with JavaScript and CSS files. The methods responsible for getting data from the database will be referenced only directly from Business Components layer or from Services layer.

In this layer you can use technologies like ASP.NET WebForms or ASP.NET MVC.
